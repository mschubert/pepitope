<p>This guide shows how to perform quality control on a library using
the barcoded constructs from Variant Calling and a sample sheet that
contains a second, sample-level barcode.</p>
<p>The library itself is generated by ordering the barcoded constructs
and then cloning them into the appropriate expression vectors to
function as MHC-presented peptides. The sample barcode is then added via
PCR primers and few rounds of amplification.</p>
<p>This workflow can be used either on the construct library, the
transduced cells, or cells after co-culture. The goal of this step is to
confirm that all constructs are present in the approriate proportions.
We provide functions to process and analyze the sequencing data.</p>

<p>The <em>Variant Calling</em> step of this package provides a table
with tiled reference and alternative peptides, along with their
respective IDs. When ordering those as gene blocks, one or more
construct barcodes are added to the sequence, so we are able to uniquely
identify our minigene peptides also when a sequencing read does not
reach the mutated base.</p>
<p>Here, we use barcodes from <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1802640115" class="external-link">this
publication</a> and <a href="https://github.com/hawkjo/freebarcodes" class="external-link">Github repository</a>:</p>

<p>These barcodes need to be of the same length and not overlap between
samples in one QC run. For the analysis, we manually add them as columns
to the peptide/minigene tables:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>barcode</code> – if only one barcode per construct</li>
<li>
<code>barcode_1</code>, <code>barcode_2</code>, etc. – if multiple
barcodes per construct</li>
</ul>
<p>The other required fields are, for each sample:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>gene_name</code> – an identifier for the gene,
e.g. <code>NRAS</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>mut_id</code> – a common identifier for <code>ref</code> and
<code>alt</code> sequences, e.g. <code>NRAS_Q61</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>pep_id</code> – a unique identifier for each peptide,
e.g. <code>NRAS_Q61L-1</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>pep_type</code> – whether this is a <code>ref</code> or
<code>alt</code> sequence (or other)</li>
<li>
<code>tiled</code> – the tiled nucleotide sequence</li>
</ul>
<p>For the QC analysis, we will need a named list of these barcoded
Minigene tables. We will usually have assembled them in a
<code>.xlsx</code> file with these barcodes added, however, here we will
use an example dataset:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="co">## normally we'd read all sheets from our barcoded construct file:</span></span>
<span><span class="co"># fname = "my_combined_barcoded_file.xlsx"</span></span>
<span><span class="co"># sheets = readxl::excel_sheets(fname)</span></span>
<span><span class="co"># all_constructs = sapply(sheets, readxl::read_xlsx, path=fname, simplify=FALSE)</span></span>
<span></span>

<p>A sequencing (FASTQ) file will contain a sample barcode, construct
barcode, and construct sequence:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="va">fastq_file</span> <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">"/path/to/your/file.fq.gz"</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Before we can start working with the FASTQ sequencing output, we need
to describe which samples it contains. For this, we create a sample
sheet with the following columns:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>sample_id</code> – a unique identifier of the sample</li>
<li>
<code>patient</code> – the patient or sample group that the sample
comes from</li>
<li>
<code>rep</code> – a number indicating the replicate number</li>
<li>
<code>origin</code> – a descriptor of which kind of sample this
is</li>
<li>
<code>barcode</code> – the barcode used to label all
condition-specific constructs in the sequencing data</li>
</ul>
<p>For this example, we have already provided a sample sheet with the
package. It includes three samples, two for library QC
(<code>pat2</code> and <code>pat3</code>) and one with mock-transfected
vs. actual peptide T-cell co-culture (<code>pat1</code>). The
<code>pat1</code> and <code>pat2</code> samples additionally include a
common construct set. Whenever we use multiple construct sets in a
sample, we separate them using a <code>+</code>:</p>

<h3 id="sample-demultiplexing">Sample demultiplexing<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#sample-demultiplexing"></a>
</h3>
<p>This step is using the <code>fqtk</code> toolkit to split the
multi-sample FASTQ file into individual sample files, separated by their
sample barcode and save to a temporary directory.</p>
<p>Here, <code>read_structures</code> describes how the split these
samples. It has the following possible fields, preceded by the number of
nucleotides in the read. A <code>+</code> instead of a number is used to
indicated to use all remaining nucleotides:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>B</code> – the sample barcode to split on (required)</li>
<li>
<code>T</code> – the read sequence with the construct barcode and
sequence (required)</li>
<li>
<code>S</code> – skip these nucleotides and do not include in output
(optional)</li>
</ul>
<p>In this example, we use a 7-nucleotide barcode for the samples and
keep the rest of the read in the split files:</p>

<p>You can perform additional quality control steps on the sample-level
FASTQ files, e.g. using <code>fastqc</code> or <code>multiqc</code> (not
included in this package).</p>

</h3>
<p>The next step is to count the construct barcodes in each individual
FASTQ file after demultiplexing. Internally, we use the
<code>guide-counter</code> tool to identify the position the construct
barcodes occur in the library reads and subsequently count the number of
occurrences. Here we pass the directory containing the demultiplexed
FASTQ files and the barcode library file with all possible (not only the
used) barcodes:</p>

<p>Here, <code>dset</code> will be a <code>SummarizedExperiment</code>
object that you can interact with the following way:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>colData(dset)</code> – access the sample metadata as
<code>data.frame</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>rowData(dset)</code> – access the construct metadata as
<code>data.frame</code>

<code>assay(dset)</code> – access the construct counts as

<p>The first overview that we want to get is to know how many barcodes
are in which demultiplexed FASTQ, and whether they match the sample we
expect them to be from. We can plot this the following way, for total
read counts on the left and number of barcodes that have 10 or more
reads on the right:</p>

</h3>
<p>The next question we want to ask is whether the individual construct
barcodes are equally distributed within a sample, and where any
potential contaminations come from. For this, we order the barcodes from
least abundant (left) to most abundant (right) and plot a continuous
line for how many reads are sequenced of this barcode on the y axis:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb12"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="fu"><a href="../reference/plot_distr.html">plot_distr</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">dset</span><span class="op">)</span></span>
<span><span class="co">#&gt; Joining with `by = join_by(barcode)`</span></span>
<span><span class="co">#&gt; Joining with `by = join_by(sample_id)`</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="qc_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png" width="700"></p>
<p>We can make a couple of observations from these plots:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>Mock</code> and <code>Sample</code> conditions worked well
for <code>pat1</code>
</li>
<li>The sample-specific barcodes for <code>pat2</code> show a high read
variance and may be unsuitable for a screen</li>
<li>About a quarter of the sample-specific barcodes for
<code>pat3</code> are lost</li>
<li>There is a sample contamination of <code>pat1</code> in
<code>pat3</code>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We can also plot this interactively with <code>plotly</code>, where
we can hover over with the mouse to see which barcode is in which
position exactly:</p>
